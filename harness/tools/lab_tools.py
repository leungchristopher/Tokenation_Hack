"""Lab tools: the agent's only interface to the simulated lab, driving Lok's lab_sim scene
through `LabBackend`. Nothing in the scene has a free joint, so no container can be grasped
or knocked over -- the only thing physically simulated is the held pipette's nozzle reaching
named sites. There is no liquid, no volume and no instrument: a call reports only whether it
succeeded, never a fabricated spill or reading, and never the robot/pipette's internal state
(tilt, tracking error, joint positions) that caused a failure -- that diagnostic detail is
recorded in the hidden ledger only, never returned to the agent.

Usage:
    tools = lab_tools()            # one lab per Inspect sample, created on first use
    tools = lab_tools(backend)     # or bind an explicit LabBackend
