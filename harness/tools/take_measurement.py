"""The technician's only way to turn a finished plan into a number.

A measurement is a real experiment: it consumes budget and becomes a node of the single
reasoning graph, linked to the parent node with the reasoning the scientist gave when it
created the plan -- the technician chooses nothing here, it only reports that the plan is done.
The reading is trustworthy only once every step of that plan has been checked off; measuring
early still costs budget but the measurement fails, leaving a node with no value attached.
